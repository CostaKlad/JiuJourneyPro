"Create an interactive RPG-style skill tree for my BJJ training app, OssRyu. The skill tree should allow users to unlock techniques as they progress, similar to an RPG game. Here‚Äôs what I need:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structure (Backend)
Store techniques in a structured format with prerequisites.
Each technique should have:
id: Unique identifier.
name: Technique name.
position: Starting position (e.g., Guard, Mount, Side Control).
difficulty: White, Blue, Purple, Brown, Black Belt categories.
description: Brief description of the move.
video_url: Link to a video tutorial.
prerequisites: List of techniques required before unlocking this one.
status: "locked" (default) or "unlocked".
Example JSON Structure:
